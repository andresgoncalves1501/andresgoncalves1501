### Hi 👋 I'm **André Gonçalves**

I'm a Javascript Fullstack Developer born and raised in Porto, Portugal 🇵🇹 now based in Dublin, Ireland 🇮🇪\
Until just recently, I worked for a company called **Jscrambler** 🛡 in the WPI product (you should check out some of their stuff)\
I've mostly familiarised myself with the Javascript and React ecosystem, but I know that there is still a long way to go 🏃\
I'm currently looking for a new challenge, and if you're interested in getting to know me, contact me through my email!
